### NFT minter Smart Contract 

**It is ready to use, but not properly tested yet! Rust devs, I would appreciate it if you could leave your insights ❤️**

**You can use [elven-tools-cli](https://github.com/juliancwirko/elven-tools-cli/tree/development) for deployment and interactions!** It is not published yet, but you can always test it locally. For now check [abi file](https://github.com/juliancwirko/elven-nft-minter-sc/blob/development/output/elven-nft-minter.abi.json) on what the SC can do.

TODO: detailed documentation!
