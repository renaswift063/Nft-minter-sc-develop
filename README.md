### Example Smart Contract [WIP]

**Rust devs, I would appreciate it if you could leave your insights ❤️**

### Usage (devnet):

**You can also use [elven-tools-cli](https://github.com/juliancwirko/elven-tools-cli) for that!**

1. Clone the repo

2. `cd elven-nft-minter-sc`

3. Build the SC using `erdpy contract build`

TODO: next steps and description

### Learning resources

- [julian.io](https://www.julian.io/)


#### TODO:

- smart contract upgrade - test if there are needed changes in the init function
- shuffle mechanism (RandomnessSource - waits for new elrond-wasm-rs)
- tests
- data checks 
- comments in the code
- additional nft roles management (optional with default set) (???)
- perf rewrites (help needed)

#### TODO (for later)
- more advanced functionality in future iterations (bidding, clearing)
- rethink usage of ESDTRoleNFTUpdateAttributes and ESDTRoleNFTAddURI
